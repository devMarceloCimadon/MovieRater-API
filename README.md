## 🖥️About the Project
The project is a case study on the creation of APIs, emphasizing the use of Java best practices with the Spring framework. These practices include customized exception handling to avoid excessive use of try/catch blocks, unit testing for methods defined in the service layer of the application, explicit relationships between database entities, and the use of Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to prevent direct database access. The example chosen for this study was a movie rating system, featuring entities such as User and Movie, along with their relationships.
