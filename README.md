## üñ•Ô∏èAbout the Project

<p>The project is a case study on the creation of APIs, emphasizing the use of Java best practices with the Spring framework. These practices include customized exception handling to avoid excessive use of try/catch blocks, unit testing for methods defined in the service layer of the application, explicit relationships between database entities, and the use of Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to prevent direct database access.</p> 
<p>The example chosen for this study was a movie rating system, featuring entities such as User and Movie, along with their relationships.</p>

## ‚öôÔ∏èFunctionalities

<p>All the classes will represent entities (tables) in our database, so we have created classes to manipulate the data in those table, specifically Repository and Service.<p>
<p>The classes also need DTO classes, to avoid access the entity directly.</p>

### User
- The User class can receive the user's username, name, email and password, and the user class also create a UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) for the user.
- User will have these relationships: 

| **Relationship** | **Name**           | **Table**  |
|------------------|--------------------|------------|
| Many to Many     | user_watchedMovies | tb_movie   |
| Many to Many     | user_watchList     | tb_movie   |
| One to Many      | reviews            | tb_reviews |

### Movie

- The Movie class can receive the movie name, the studio name and a list of cast, the movie class also auto increment a Long type identifier.
- Movie final grade will be calculated every time a review was created.
- Movie will have these relationships:

| **Relationship** | **Name**       | **Table**  |
|------------------|----------------|------------|
| Many to One      | studio         | tb_studio  |
| Many to Many     | usersWatched   | tb_user    |
| Many to Many     | usersWatchList | tb_user    |
| Many to Many     | movies_cast    | tb_artist  |
| One to Many      | reviews        | tb_reviews |

### Artist
- The Artist class only can receive the artist name, the artist class also auto increment a Long type identifier.
- Artist will have these relationships:

| **Relationship** | **Name** | **Table** |
|------------------|----------|-----------|
| Many to Many     | movies   | tb_movie  |

### Studio
- The Studio class only can receive the studio name, the studio class also auto increment a Long type identifier.
- Studio will have these relationships:

| **Relationship** | **Name** | **Table** |
|------------------|----------|-----------|
| Many to Many     | movies   | tb_movie  |

### Review
- The Review class can receive a user username, a movie name, a grade from the film watched and a content of review, the studio class also auto increment a Long type identifier.
- Review will have these relationships:

| **Relationship** | **Name** | **Table** |
|------------------|----------|-----------|
| Many to One      | user     | tb_user   |
| Many to One      | movie    | tb_movie  |
